Abstract
African elephants play a crucial role in shaping the ecosystems they inhabit, but their populations face
threats from poaching, habitat loss, and conflict with human communities. This research project aims
to model the movement patterns and habitat selection criteria of elephants within Kruger National
Park, South Africa. Using Step Selection Functions and an Agent-Based Modeling approach, the study
examines how environmental variables and human-related factors shape elephant behaviour and their
spatial distribution within the Park. We utilize the telemetry data track of 14 female elephants collected
in Kruger National Park from 2007 to 2009. Our findings indicate that elephants exhibit preference for
areas with abundant green vegetation, low temperatures and agricultural areas. Conversely, they tend
to avoid areas with high elevation, higher temperatures and rainfall. Although certain factors alternate
between eliciting positive and negative responses from elephants, these variables effectively describe their
behaviour within Kruger National Park. The insights gained here aim to help park planning initiatives
to reduce human-elephant conflicts to ensure the long-term survival of vulnerable populations.
